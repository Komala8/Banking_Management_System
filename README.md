**Create the tables**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user(
       full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE accounts(
       account_number BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       balance DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
       security_pin CHAR(4) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

 **Update the database connection details** in `BankingApp.java`:

   ```java
   private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_system";
   private static final String username = "root";
   private static final String password = "Admin@123";
   ```



## üß© How It Works

2. Choose **Register** to create a new user account.
3. Log in using your email and password.
4. Open a new bank account with an initial deposit and PIN.
